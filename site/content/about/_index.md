Prospex is an award-winning grassroots youth charity based in Islington, supporting young people aged 8-21* whose life chances are affected through measures outside their control; poverty, social deprivation, high unemployment and crime.
Islington is the 12th most deprived local authority in the country and the 4th most deprived in London.

35% of Islington’s children are living in low income families and just under one in three young people live in households where nobody is working. And worryingly, Islington children are 33% more likely to suffer from mental health issues than the national average.

Founded in 2001, the organisation works to address these negative influences, often resulting in low self-esteem and poor school attendance, leading to limited employment prospects.  We establish positive relationships and provide opportunities, build life and employability skills. Young people are able to broaden their horizons outside the limits of their existing thinking and are given the tools to achieve their goals.
Our

Vision:                                                                                                                                            We aim to support the young people with whom we come into contact by building a safe environment that enables them to reach their full potential. Whether this means taking homeless teenagers on their first trip to see the ocean, or ensuring that the girls we work with are empowered and confident, we believe that every child deserves to live a life filled with fun and enriching experiences.
Our Values:

Inclusive: Constant respect for all young people, irrespective of culture, gender or creed.
Family Value: We believe that our role is to support parents in getting the best outcomes for their children.
Potential: Equip young people to build their potential.   
Positive Living: Be it the food they eat or the way they communicate with their peers, we believe in creating a healthy lifestyle for our young people.


 We aim to provide support for 21-24 as they transition out of our care. This is not attached to any grant or funding and is undertaken as a voluntary in staff members’ own time.
