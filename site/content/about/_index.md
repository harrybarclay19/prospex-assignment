Our team does more than just meet and engage with young people within the confines of the centre.
We have been advocates for our children and teens with school, the police, and other authorities. We meet with parents and their peers to help mediate conflicts, and accompany them to meetings or important appointments to provide support.

If we feel their voices are not being heard, we speak up, and encourage them to do the same. We listen when they need us to, and signpost them to other organisations where necessary.
Our team and volunteers build lasting, meaningful relationships with the young people who come to us. We let them be themselves and engage in positive activities designed to promote and stimulate healthy bodies and healthy minds.
