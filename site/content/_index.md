blurb:
    heading: Our Mission
    text: "Islington - a highly overpopulated area with two sides, the leafy mansions of the upper class and the low-income households in which a third of under-sixteens live. In one in three Islington households, no-one is employed. Over half of single parents in the borough – mostly mothers – are out of work. Just a fifth are in full employment, half the national average. It’s also full of young people with drive, creativity, ideas – and enormous potential. But without safe green spaces, playgrounds, or youth centres, they have nowhere to grow. And without the financial freedom to travel to other areas of the city, they cannot benefit from better local provisions elsewhere. We don’t want their energy and ambitions to go to waste. Can you help?
"
intro:
    heading: "What we do"
    text: "Young people want places to go. In Islington, they have a number of options, but few of them are free. Community centres in estates have been closed, or are being redeveloped. Many don’t feel safe travelling to the places which remain open because of high incidence of crime or antisocial behaviour. Prospex gives them somewhere to learn, play, or just relax – closer to home.

      text: "Our youth hubs offer a safe space for young people to meet new people, learn new skills, and enjoy themselves in an environment designed to promote positive wellbeing. We have a ‘Healthy Bodies, Healthy Minds’ approach – stimulating both the physical body, and the mind.

      text: "We run regular cooking, gardening, arts and crafts, team building, and personal development sessions, coupled with sports, physical activity and trips to the countryside.
      Whatever they feel like doing, whoever they are, and whoever they wish to be, we want every young person to find a home at Prospex.

      text: "Each year, we provide over 4000 meals to Islington’s children and 1800 hours of free child care to the parents whose children use our service. For many of our parents, the existence of Prospex’s centre based work is the difference between being able to work and having to stay at home."
