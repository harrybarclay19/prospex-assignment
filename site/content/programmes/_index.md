      Our Street Teams exist to make sure young people are safe and well, wherever they are. If they’d rather not come to the centre, our staff check in on them in their local area. This builds a mutual trust and allows positive relationships to be formed. Our team become familiar faces, and get to know the wider community as well as the young people themselves. Our joint Street Team and Youth Work Centre Based approach has had positive impacts by helping to reduce anti social behaviour in localised areas. Our Street Teams have also helped young people back into work, education and apprenticeships.

      We allocate young people a Dedicated One2One worker based on their needs and circumstances. Our One2one work could range from a few sessions helping a young person complete a application form, to many years working with them and their families to help overcome a range of complex issues which, together, can have a serious impact on their wellbeing. Through regular one-to-one sessions with their personal worker, young people have a constant in their life – someone who will listen to them, encourage them, raise their aspirations and give them the confidence to overcome anything.

      Our Centre is open for young people aged 8 to 24. Three times a week we not only teach the young people how to make a nutritious meal, but we also encourage them to sit and enjoy their dinner together. Once a week, we offer an empowerment session for girls, and as of 2019 this will be extended to a boys session also. Prospex are keen to ensure that the women leaving our service are confident and aware of the importance of independence. Further to this, every Christmas, our staff provide a gifts and christmas dinner to the families of our children that cannot afford it.
